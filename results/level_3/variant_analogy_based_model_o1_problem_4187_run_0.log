Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: sine of angle BAC
- Model answer: 1/2
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Right Triangles: ACB
  Polygons: ACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  sin_BAC <= 1
  sin_BAC >= -1
  ∠BAC <= 180
  ∠BAC > 0

Please fix the proof.

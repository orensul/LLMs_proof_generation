Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <adjacent_complementary_angle> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: adjacent_complementary_angle(A,F,B,B,F,C)

Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example:
For variation 1: adjacent_complementary_angle(1, A,F,B,B,F,C)

Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:

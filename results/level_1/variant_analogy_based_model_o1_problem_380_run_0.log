Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <triangle_area_formula_common> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: triangle_area_formula_common(A,C,B)

Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example:
For variation 1: triangle_area_formula_common(1, A,C,B)
